Code and Data - "On the PM2.5 – Mortality Association: A Bayesian Model for Spatio-Temporal Confounding"

This repository contains R scripts associated to the manuscript "On the PM2.5 – Mortality Association: A Bayesian Model for Spatio-Temporal Confounding" by Carlo Zaccardi, Pasquale Valentini, Luigi Ippoliti and Alexandra M. Schmidt ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16106)).

Please use the code provided to fit the _Spatial Dynamic Generalized Linear Model for Confounding (SDGLMC)_.

## Content of this repository:
- _main.R_: please run this file
- _functions.R_: constains the main function to fit SDGLMC
- _example_dataset.RData_: contains simulated spatio-temporal data
- _Wcont.csv_, _centroids.csv_, _offset.csv_: additional files needed for the analysis
